'''Checking Whether a Value Is in a List:
To find out whether a particular value is already in a list, use the keyword 
in. Let's consider some code you might write for a pizzeria. We'll 
make a list of toppings a customer has requested for a pizza and then 
check whether certain toppings are in the list.
'''
requested_toppings = ['mushrooms', 'onions', 'pineapple']
print("Is 'mushrooms' in requested_toppings? I predict True!")
print('mushrooms' in requested_toppings)

print("\nIs 'pepperoni' in requested_toppings? I predict False!")
print('pepperoni' in requested_toppings)
